# Twitter GeoSpatial Visualization
 This repository contains geospatial visualization of twitter data, We had collected four months of twitter about 1TB. Visualization of all these data looks confusing to which tweet belongs to which category. For better understanding of the visualization We had filter the tweets by the terms of interest. Below you can see the 2D-Visuliazation of the tweets

In 2D Visualiztion of twitter data you can only find in which place more tweets are apper, you can find complete information like in which coordinate more tweets appering. We don't this kind of information in 2D Visulization. To visualize the tweets in 3D manner we had used [kepler GL](https://kepler.gl/).

###### 3D visulization of Tweets in New York Area

In kepler.gl we've different options for visualization the data like clustering, Hexabin, Polygon, etc., We're going to visualize this data in Hexabins. In Hexabins we can also choose in how much distance we want between two tweets to bin up. Also we can choose elavation height for better understading of the tweets.

From this figure below you can easily find in which place more number tweets are coming.

Let's visulize the tweets in San Francisco and New York

# Twitter GeoSpatial Visualization
 This repository contains geospatial visualization of twitter data, We had collected four months of twitter about 1TB. Visualization of all these data looks confusing to which tweet belongs to which category. For better understanding of the visualization We had filter the tweets by the terms of interest. Below you can see the 2D-Visuliazation of the tweets

In 2D Visualiztion of twitter data you can only find in which place more tweets are apper, you can find complete information like in which coordinate more tweets appering. We don't this kind of information in 2D Visulization. To visualize the tweets in 3D manner we had used [kepler GL](https://kepler.gl/)
